# Test-Case-Prioritization
Test Case prioritization using genetic algorithms.  <br/>
The objective is to identify the optimal order in which the set of tests should be run using Genetic Algorithms. <br/>
The problem uses a fault matrix identifies for each of the 216 tests, which of the associated 9 faults they reveal - indicated by a 1. <br/>
The problem makes use of a concept called APFD(Average Percentage of Faults Detected) which is a metric used in software testing to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite in detecting faults. It provides a quantitative measure of how well a test suite is performing in terms of identifying and localizing defects in the tested software. <br/>
